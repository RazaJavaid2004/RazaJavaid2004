## 🚀 Featured Projects

### RSA, AES & DES Encryption-Decryption Suite

A comprehensive cryptography toolkit implementing three major encryption standards — RSA (asymmetric), AES (symmetric), and DES (symmetric) — designed for secure data handling and modular algorithm comparison.

**Key Features:**
- RSA key generation and public/private encryption  
- AES encryption with selectable key sizes (128/192/256-bit)  
- DES encryption/decryption with fixed 56-bit key  
- Modular class-based architecture for each algorithm  
- CLI interface for testing and comparing encryption workflows  
- Sample input/output files for real-world simulation

**Tech Stack:** C++ | Modular Class Design  
**Use Case:** Ideal for demonstrating foundational cryptography concepts in cybersecurity education, ethical hacking labs, and secure messaging systems.
